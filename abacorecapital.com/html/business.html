                <p>Abacore owns an 18.23% stake in <a href="http://www.loto.com.ph/"> Pacific Online Systems Corporation   
                (POSC)</a>.&nbsp; <font FACE="Arial">POSC leases online betting   
                equipment to the Philippine Charity Sweepstakes</font> <font FACE="Arial">Office   
                (PCSO) for the latter’s lottery operations in Visayas and   
                Mindanao (VisMin).</p>    
                    
                </font>    
    
                <p>POSC utilizes the computer hardware and operating system software provided by Scientific Games International (SGI), an Irish company.  The versatile AEGIS&trade; operating system can connect using both landline and wireless telecommunications networks and is therefore well suited to the “hybrid” telecommunications backbone existing in the Philippines. It has the added advantage of enabling PCSO to open betting outlets in areas without landline connection.</p>     
                     
                <font FACE="Arial">  
                <p ALIGN="LEFT">Developments in POSC’s business have been especially brisk  
                starting 2007. The year saw the installation of a total of 504  
                new terminals, bringing the   
                total number of terminals in the VisMin area to almost 1,500. In July 2007, POSC launched the “Instant   
                Scratch Lottery” with the introduction of the <i>Triple Cash</i>  
                and <i>Money Bags</i> games, to which were added two new  
                variants, the <i>P200,00 Payday</i> and the <i>Lucky 8's</i>  
                games in January 2008. In September 2007, POSC completed its acquisition   
                of Lucky Circle Corporation (LCC), with exclusive rights   
                to lotto outlets in SM Supermalls nationwide.&nbsp; LCC had 48 lotto  
                outlets as of end 2007 and expects to increase this to 75 in 2008.  
                POSC has also joined forces with Prime Gaming Management Corporation and   
                Wolfpac Mobile to launch the “Second Chance Lotto Test Panalo   
                Promo”, a game that makes use of the network of Smart and Talk-n-Text   
                to provide lotto players a second chance to win raffle prizes   
                via short-message-service (SMS) or texting.</p>

                <p ALIGN="LEFT">Lotto sales in Visayas and Mindanao have   
                registered a steady increase, resulting in increasing lease   
                revenues for POSC of P333 million in   
                2005, P402 million in 2006 and P480 million in 2007. Projected  
                full-year net income for 2007 is   
                P170 million.</p>

                <p>POSC was listed at the Philippine Stock Exchange on April 12,  
                2007. The initial public offering consisted of 39,800,000 shares  
                which were sold at the opening price of P8.88 per share.  Proceeds from the offering will be used for capital expenditures and working capital requirements.&nbsp;</p>
