                <small>PHILSTAR.COM, December 27, 2011<br>By ZINNIA B. DELA PEÑA</small></p> 
                     
                <p style="text-align: justify;" class="MsoNormal"><span>MANILA, Philippines - Listed holding firm Abacus Consolidated Resources & Holdings Inc. said it expects 2012 to be a banner year for the company as it steps up activities in mining and real estate.</span></p>    
                <p style="text-align: justify;" class="MsoNormal"><span>In a disclosure to the stock exchange, Abacus president Leonardo Gayao said revenues to be generated from new business decisions would boost its profitability next year.</span></p>    
                <p style="text-align: justify;" class="MsoNormal"><span>Gayao said the company approved the assignment or transfer of gold mining rights to fully-owned unit Abacus Goldmines Exploration & Development Corp. The move is in preparation for the entry of a joint venture partner – a Chinese group with whom Abacus has been in talks with.</span></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;" class="MsoNormal"><span>The assignment, together with the necessary procedure of estimating and appraising the mining rights, is expected to result in an income of P300 million for Abacus.</span></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;" class="MsoNormal"><span>Aside from this, Abacus is going full blast in its selling efforts in its real estate venture in Batangas as it has already received from the Housing & Land Use Regulatory Board the permit to sell for its MonteMaria real estate project and its condominium units, all located in Batangas City.</span></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;" class="MsoNormal"><span>Abacus also decided to consolidate the company’s operation, focusing on operations of a non-bank financial institution. It consolidated its investment house subsidiary Philippine Regional Investment Development Corp., which has under its wings a mutual fund, Philippine International Infrastructure Fund, and various real estate development companies.</span></p>
			<p style="text-align: justify;" class="MsoNormal"><span>In line with the consolidation, the real estate holdings will be re-appraised to reflect current values, thereby generating an appraisal increase that is estimated to reach no less than P200 million.</span></p>
			<p style="text-align: justify;" class="MsoNormal"><span>Moreover, Abacus approved the reclassification of its investment in Pacific Online Systems Corp., which will result in book value of the shares by at least P100 million.<span></p>
