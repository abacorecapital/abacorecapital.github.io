                <p><b>Haven of Infinity Memorial Garden.</b>&nbsp;  
                The Haven of Infinity Memorial Garden, straddling Lipa City and the  
                town of San Jose,Batangas, will be built on prime property covering  
                an area of approximately 7.8 hectares, directly accessible through  
                the national highway. Abacore plans to construct a chapel, crematorium,  
                mortuary and columbarium amid spacious parks and gardens.  This  
                project is expected to attract buyers from Lipa City, San Jose and  
                other nearby towns in Batangas, especially in view of the rising demand  
                for decent memorial parks. Abacore has secured the approval of  
                local governments and is in the process of completing environmental 
                requirements.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
